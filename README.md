Today, I’ve made significant progress in understanding Shopify development. I learned how to add products to the cart using the form and input elements in Liquid. This involves sending product data to the backend using the /cart/add action, which allows users to add products directly to their cart on the product page.

I also worked on filtering products within a collection. Using pagination, I filtered products based on different criteria such as price and vendor. I explored Liquid filters like sort, where, uniq, and reverse to organize products based on various attributes.

In addition, I focused on displaying product details such as the title, price, and variant options. I’ve implemented dropdowns for variant selection and quantity input fields, which will update the cart dynamically.

On the design side, I refined the layout of the product page, making sure it has a clean, user-friendly interface. I styled the product page and product items using custom CSS to ensure a cohesive and attractive design.

Overall, I’ve made great strides today in understanding Shopify Liquid and backend communication, and I’m now better equipped to create a functional and visually appealing product page.
